/**
 * Onboarding permission tiers — one clear question instead of silent
 * fail-closed defaults + manual file editing. A tier is THE user's choice at
 * onboarding, so it must EXECUTE: it writes the full permissions.yaml
 * (single source of truth) — both the tool gate AND the path scopes. The old
 * manifest-only behavior left the path gate untouched, so a "Full access"
 * bot still could not read anything outside its sandbox — chosen
 * permissions that never took effect.
 *
 * Path grants per tier (fail-closed outside these):
 *  - readonly: own profile dir, read-only
 *  - builder:  own profile dir, read+write
 *  - operator: own profile dir, read+write+execute
 *  - full:     the whole home directory, read+write+execute — an explicit,
 *              informed choice for trusted automation (the global blocked
 *              list still applies; interactive tools stay stripped).
